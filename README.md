### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**knorth2/knorth2** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

My name is Kayci and Iâ€™ve recently made the career pivot to software engineering and am currently completing a coding bootcamp at General Assembly. My creative problem solving and attention to detail are a few of my skills that I will take with me from my previous career in Physical Therapy. 
Currently learning Javascript.
