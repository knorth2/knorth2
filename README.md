My name is Kayci and I am currently in a Software Engineering Immersive program through General Assembly. I am looking to take my skills that I have attained in my previous career (Physical Therapy) and cultivate them to fit in to a career in programming. I am a creative problem solver with an eye for design and attention to detail.
